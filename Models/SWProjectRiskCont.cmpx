The node has parent node 'total effective effort' and its NPT is based on published data and models from the likes of Boehm (COCOMO), Putnam, and Capers Jones to capture the relationship between effort and functionality delivered.  In most cases users of the model would be expected to input an observation on this node -  either as an estimate of what they want to deliver or as an assessment of what they have delivered.  The nice thing about function points is that they are supposed to be independent of language and independent of project phase (if you know your requirements then the number of funtion points you intend to implement should be the same as you end up implementing).  However, if you do not happen to use function points as a sizing measure then it will obviously be impractical for you to enter a sensible observation on this node.  Hence, the model allows you to enter observations via a number of indicators - the most obvious of which is Thousands of Lines of Code (KLOC). However, you should always be aware that there may be pitfalls of doing this. Apart from the well known ones in the literature, the BN model may produce what look like strange results (but are in fact completely rational) if you place too great an emphasis on assuming KLOC is a perfect indicator of FP. For example, if you believe you are delivering a 'big system' by putting in a high KLOC value then the BN will, as you would expect attach a high probability that FP is also high. However, this is not certain. Hence, depending on what other observations are entered in the model, the BN may decide that, irrespective of the high KLOC the FP is probably low. Hence a sensible strategy for using the model if you do not know anything about FP is:\r\n1)  enter a KLOC observation \r\n2) enter an observation about your programming language (in the question Language)\r\n3) Display the monitor for new functionlaity delivered\r\n4) Run calculate and note the resulting calculated median value for new functionality delivered\r\n5) Enter this median value as an observation for new functionality delivered ","type":"observation","network":"Project Level_0"},{"mode":"numerical","syncName":false,"node":"KLOC","visible":true,"name":"---KLOC delivered","answers":[{"name":"-Infinity - -1.0","state":"-Infinity - -1.0"},{"name":"-1.0 - 1.0","state":"-1.0 - 1.0"},{"name":"1.0 - Infinity","state":"1.0 - Infinity"}],"description":"The classic thousands of lines of delivered source code.

So, for a given amount of effective effort e we have a distribution f(e) of the number of function points delivered. Thus, we know in advance how many function points we can reasonably expect to deliver for a given effort e (it is f(e)). If we know that we actually deliver f' function points then the 'distance' between f' and f(e) will largely determine the quality delivered. If f' is significantly more than f(e) then we can expect the distribution for quality to be skewed toward low. This is because the data tells us that to deliver a lot of functionality with little effective effort will probably result in poor quality. If f' is significantly less than f(e) then we can expect the distribution for quality to be skewed toward good quality (a lot of effective effort used to deliver relatively little functionality).

A good specification process could result in a very clear specification that designers and coders will find a pleasure to implement - but it might be completely wrong, i.e. inaccurate in terms of the true user/system requirements. This node is a synthetic node that combines 'requirements difficulty' and ' Spec process quality'. The probability table is based partly on material already elicited for AID.  You would normally not enter an observation for this node since doing so blocks any information entered on its ancestor nodes.","type":"observation","network":"Project Level_0"}],"description":"Enter a long description here"}],"graphics":{"paneSettings":{"rightPaneExpanded":false,"scenarioPaneExpanded":false,"leftPaneExpanded":false,"selectedRiskObject":"Project Level_0"},"canvasData":["1.0\nuk.co.agena.minerva.model.metadata.MetaDataItem=0\nuk.co.agena.minerva.guicomponents.diagramcanvas.CanvassObjectGrouping~true~0~-1~-1~$0$~$0$~0~0~0~1~1.0~1~1.0~0~0~255~255~255~uk.co.agena.minerva.model.extendedbn.ExtendedBN=0\nuk.co.agena.minerva.guicomponents.diagramcanvas.CanvassPolygon~true~1~0~-1~Frame~$0$~0~0~0~1~1.0~1~1.0~1~0~255~255~255~$0$~0=0.0,50.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0~1=123.328125,50.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0~1=123.328125,90.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0~1=0.0,90.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0~1=0.0,50.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0~4=0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0~\nuk.co.agena.minerva.guicomponents.diagramcanvas.CanvassLabel~true~2~0~-1~Title~$0$~0~0~0~1~1.0~1~0.6~1~1~255~255~255~uk.co.agena.minerva.model.extendedbn.ExtendedBN=0~0=0.0,50.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0~1=123.328125,50.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0~1=123.328125,70.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0~1=0.0,70.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0~1=0.0,50.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0~4=0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0~~Project Level~11~Dialog.bold~1~0~0~0~1~1~2~2\nuk.co.agena.minerva.guicomponents.diagramcanvas.CanvassLabel~true~3~0~-1~NoIONodes~$0$~0~0~0~1~1.0~1~0.6~0~1~255~255~255~$0$~0=0.0,70.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0~1=123.328125,70.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0~1=123.328125,90.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0~1=0.0,90.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0~1=0.0,70.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0~4=0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0~~No Input/Ouput nodes~10~Dialog.bold~1~0~0~0~1~1~2~2","1.0\nuk.co.agena.minerva.model.extendedbn.ExtendedBN=0\nuk.co.agena.minerva.guicomponents.diagramcanvas.CanvassObjectGrouping~false~0~-1~-1~$0$~$0$~0~0~0~1~1.0~1~1.0~0~0~255~255~255~$0$\nuk.co.agena.minerva.guicomponents.diagramcanvas.CanvassLabel~true~1~0~-1~$0$~$0$~192~192~192~1~1.0~1~1.0~0~1~255~255~255~$0$~0=41.0,29.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0~1=295.0,29.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0~1=295.0,450.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0~1=41.0,450.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0~1=41.0,29.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0~4=0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0~~This model enables risk assessment of large-scale software projects, including the capability to model the trade-offs between cost, quality, schedule, and functionality.
